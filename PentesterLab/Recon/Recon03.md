# Recon 03

## Descrição
* For this challenge, your goal is to find a directory with directory listing in the main website for hackycorp.com.

## Dicas
* When accessing a directory on a webserver, multiple things can happen:
**an "index" file is present and it will get returned. N.B.: the file is not necessarily named index, this can be configured. But most of the time, the file will benamed index.html
**no "index" file is present and the webserver will list the content of the directory. This can obviously leak information.
**Indexing directory can be disabled on most webservers. For example, with Apache, you need to use the option: -Indexes.
*To find directories, with indexing turned on. You need to browse the source of the HTML pages and look at the directories used to store files. Once you have a list of directories, you can access each of them individually.

## Resolução
