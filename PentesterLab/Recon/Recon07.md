# Recon 07

## Descrição
* For this challenge, your goal is to access the default virtual host ("vhost").

## Dicas
* When accessing a new webserver, it often pays off to replace the hostname with the IP address or to provide a random Host header in the request. To do this, you can either modify the request in a web proxy.
* This time you need to check the TLS version of the website to get the key

## Resolução
* Usando o comando curl -H "Host:hackycorp" hackycorp.com obteremos a flag.
